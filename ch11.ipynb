    "> We wish to implement a dictionary by using direct addressing on a *huge* array. At the start, the array entries may ontain garbage, and initializing the entire array is impractical because of its size. Describe a scheme for implementing a direct-address dictionary on a huge array. Each stored object should use $O(1)$ space. The operations search, insert, and delete should take $O(1)$ time each; and initializing the data structure should take $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested by hint, we use two arrays (actually, three arrays)\n",

    "Let's denote the huge array by $T$. We implement the stack using an array $S$, we also use an array $S'$ allocated to be the same size as $S$.\n",

    "- Insert: To insert object $x$ with key $k$, assuming that this object is not already in the dictionary, we increment $top[S]$, set $S'[top[S]]\\leftarrow x$, set $S[top[S]]\\leftarrow k$ and set $T[k]\\leftarrow top[S]$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delete: To delete object x with key k, assuming that this object is in the dictionary, we need to break the validating cycle. The trick is to also ensure that we don't leave a hole in the stack, and we solve this problem by moving the top entry of the stack into the position that we are vacating - and then fixing up that entry's validating cycle. That is, we execute the following sequence of assignments:\n",

    "$$top[S] \\leftarrow top[S] − 1$$\n",

    "- Search: Given key k, we check whether we have a validating cycle, i.e., whether $1 \\leq T [k] \\leq top[S]$ and $S[T [k]] = k$. If so, we return $S′[T [k]]$,and otherwise we return NIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see here, we maintain an 1-1 correspondance between the two lists (validating cycle), otherwise we couldn't do searches in $O(1)$."
